why_it_matters:
  - Recon is the foundation of offensive security, yet it’s underdeveloped in most detection programs.
  - Without recon awareness, organizations cannot understand how they are being fingerprinted or profiled.
  - External attack surface mapping is vital for red, blue, and purple teams — and a core CISO concern.
  - A mature recon program improves adversary attribution, threat anticipation, and zero-day discovery.

objectives:
  - Document enumeration techniques, scanning tactics, and passive recon methods.
  - Build detection logic that identifies adversarial recon before exploitation.
  - Create asset fingerprinting playbooks and tools for blue teams.
  - Deliver a recon automation dashboard and mapping layer for threat analysts.

target_audience:
  - Red/purple teams and adversarial simulation groups
  - Blue teams and SOC analysts focused on early signal detection
  - CISOs building visibility across unknown attack surfaces
