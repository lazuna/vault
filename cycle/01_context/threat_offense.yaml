why_it_matters:
  - Offensive security provides critical insights into adversary behavior, misconfigurations, and real-world impact.
  - Without understanding threat actor TTPs, defensive controls become theoretical and disconnected from actual risk.
  - CISO-level strategy must include red teaming awareness and offensive-informed detection design.
  - Mapping and simulating threats proactively allows for risk-driven security posture optimization.

objectives:
  - Catalog tooling and methodologies used for offensive recon, exploitation, and post-exploitation.
  - Highlight detection blind spots revealed through simulated attacks.
  - Build threat-informed use cases that feed into detection engineering and blue team playbooks.
  - Create a reference for offensive capability maturity in modern security programs.

target_audience:
  - Red teamers and penetration testers
  - Detection engineers and threat hunters
  - Purple teams bridging attack and defense
  - CISOs using offensive data to justify prioritization
