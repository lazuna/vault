why_it_matters:
  - SIEM platforms are the operational backbone of enterprise security, integrating log aggregation, correlation, and real-time detection.
  - Despite wide adoption, many SIEMs fail due to misconfigured use cases, lack of contextual enrichment, and alert fatigue.
  - Strategic SIEM implementation allows organizations to evolve from passive logging to active detection and response capability.
  - A CISO candidate must demonstrate the ability to define, design, and scale detection logic within business-aligned contexts.

objectives:
  - Create modular YAML-based detection logic across categories (e.g., access, insider threat, cloud).
  - Align use cases to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF, and CIS Controls.
  - Automate detection lifecycle using rulesets, dashboards, and AI-parsable outputs.
  - Deliver executive-ready reports, detection indexes, and visualization layers.

target_audience:
  - CISO-track engineers
  - SOC leads and detection engineers
  - Threat hunters and purple teams
  - Enterprise security architects
