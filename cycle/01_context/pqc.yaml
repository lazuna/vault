topic: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
version: 1.0
status: in_progress
maintainer: ragverus
last_updated: 2025-07-16

why_it_matters:
  - Post-quantum threats are inevitable — quantum computers will break RSA and ECC within the next decade.
  - NIST has finalized its first set of post-quantum standards, accelerating the need for cryptographic agility.
  - Most organizations are unprepared for crypto migration, and CISO leaders must begin planning now.
  - Understanding PQC is no longer theoretical — it is operational risk and future-proofing strategy.

objectives:
  - Explain foundational lattice-based crypto concepts using CISO-friendly abstractions.
  - Build a comparative map of PQC schemes (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium) with real-world tradeoffs.
  - Provide playbooks for PQC migration across legacy enterprise architecture.
  - Prepare YAML and vector-based outputs suitable for AI security agents or policy generators.

target_audience:
  - CISO candidates focused on crypto strategy
  - Cryptographic engineers
  - CISOs and risk managers planning long-term transformation
  - Educators building next-generation crypto curricula
