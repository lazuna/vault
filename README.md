**Vault** is a structured system of cybersecurity knowledge, detection logic, operational design, and professional growth — built for long-term mastery, not short-term likes.

It’s not a blog. Not a dump.  
It’s versioned, curated, and evolves every Tuesday.

---

## 📁 Structure

- `knowledge/` — Threat modeling, detection chains, recon methods, cloud security, and compliance layers.
- `projects/` — Real-world code, pipelines, and recon labs.
- `growth/` — CISO-track progress maps, communication, and leadership development.
- `meta/` — Architecture, changelogs, policy intent, contribution stance.

## 🔁 Update Cadence

**Drops every Tuesday.**  
Each release expands Vault’s operational surface — one layer at a time.

## 🧭 Purpose

It is for practitioners, not spectators.  
It is for the future CISO.
