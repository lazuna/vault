# Security by Design

A working philosophy of systems that secure themselves â€” through architecture, not patchwork.

## Principles
- Signal fidelity over volume
- Identity as perimeter
- Context-aware enforcement
- Observability built-in, not bolted-on

> "A breach is often a design flaw that passed audit."
